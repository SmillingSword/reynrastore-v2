- [ ] Test complete payment flow

## Current Status: Phase 3 Complete - Ready for Frontend Implementation

## Summary of Implementation:
✅ **Security Infrastructure**: Enhanced security service with QRIS-specific validations, fraud detection, and payment integrity checks
✅ **Database**: Added security fields migration for orders table
✅ **Middleware**: Created PaymentSecurityMiddleware for request validation and rate limiting
✅ **QRIS Service**: Complete QRIS payment service with Midtrans integration
✅ **Payment Controller**: Enhanced with QRIS endpoints and security features
✅ **API Routes**: Added secure QRIS payment endpoints
✅ **Configuration**: QRIS-specific configuration with security settings

## Next Steps:
1. Run database migrations to add security fields
2. Create frontend QRIS payment component
3. Test the complete payment flow
4. Security audit and validation
